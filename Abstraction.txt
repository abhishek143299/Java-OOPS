Abstraction:- hideing the implementation and showing only functionality to the user.....

Abstract class:--
              
			a class which is declared as an abstract keyword is known as abstract class
            abstract class contains abstract methods and non abstract methods

            it can have final method which cannot be changed in sub class........

class Cmr extends Collage
{
  void clgname()
  {
      System.out.println("we are cmrec sturdents");
  }
}
public class Main
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        Cmr clg = new Cmr();
        clg.clgname();
        collage=temp;
